\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rw}
In this section we explain how our work is related to the previous works.
\subsection{Point Set Registration with GMM Representation}
\label{subsec:gmmreg}
There are a serious of works that uses gaussion mixture model as representation for point set to formulate the registration problem.
\cite{CPD} consider the registration of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. They force the Gaussian mixture model centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. Their method is appliable to both rigid registration and non-rigid registration. As we highlighted in section \ref{sec:intro}, our problem is different from the non-rigid registration considered in \cite{CPD}, the point drift could be non-coherent in our probelm.\cite{GMM_PAMI} summarized the works for point set registration using gaussian mixture models and present a unified framework for the rigid and nonrigid point set registration problem. These works select one of the point set as the ``model''. Unlike these works, \cite{Evangelidis2014} treats all the point sets as data: they are all realizations of a Gaussian mixture and the registration is cast into a clustering problem. Comparing to these works, our work is most related to \cite{Evangelidis2014}. Our formulation can be seen as an extention of the formulation of \cite{Evangelidis2014} to simultaneously handle joint registration and co-segmentation.
\subsection{Image segmentation and co-segmentation}
\label{subsec:coseg}
\cite{grabcut} is an influential work for interactive image segmentation. It uses two Gaussian mixture model, one for foreground and one for background. 
Our work is most related to \cite{Taniai_2016_CVPR}.
