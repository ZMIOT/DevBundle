\label{sec:rw}
In this section we explain how our work is related to the previous works.
\subsection{Point Set Registration with GMM Representation}
\label{subsec:gmmreg}
There are a serious of works that uses gaussion mixture model as representation for point set to formulate the registration problem.
\cite{TPS_RPM}\\
\cite{CPD}\\
\cite{GMM_PAMI} summarized the works for point set registration
using gaussian mixture models and present a unified framework for the rigid and nonrigid point set registration problem.
Comparing to these previous works, our work is most related to \cite{Evangelidis2014}. Our formulation can be seen as an extention of the formulation of \cite{Evangelidis2014} to simultaneously handle joint registration and co-segmentation.
