\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rw}
In this section we explain how our work is related to the previous work on point set processing and how we draw experiences from these methods. 

%\subsection{Point Set Registration with GMM Representation}
%\label{subsec:gmmreg}
\noindent{\textbf{Point Set Registration with GMM Representation.}}
There is a series of approaches that use Gaussian mixture model as \mdf{the} representation for point set registration problems \cxj{due to its general ability of representing point sets for both rigid and non-rigid registation}.
%
%
A \mdf{comprehensive} survey about approaches for point set registration using Gaussian mixture models can be found in \cite{GMM_PAMI}. 
They also present a unified framework for rigid and nonrigid registration problems. 
%
These methods select one of the point sets as the ``model'' and align other point sets with this \mdf{template}. \cxj{Is it better to use "template" than ``model''?} 
%
Myroeko and Song consider the registration of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem, and use Gaussian mixture model to represent the geometry and force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets \cite{CPD}. This method is applicable to both rigid registration and non-rigid registration. \cxj{Does this method treat one point set as the template?}
%
As we highlighted in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, our problem is different from the non-rigid registration while the point drift is non-coherent in our \mdf{problem}.
%
Unlike these works, \cite{Evangelidis2014} treats all point sets equally.
They are all realizations of a Gaussian mixture model and the registration is cast into a clustering problem. 
A recent method pushes this idea to the application on a large scale dataset~\cite{GOGMA}. 
Comparing to these methods, our method can be seen as an extension of the formulation of \cite{Evangelidis2014} to simultaneously handle joint registration and co-segmentation. 
\cxj{It should not be a simple extension. You should highlight what is the most challeging part we solved compared with others. I would say: } \mdf{In comparison, we employ the same GMM representation of object models while we formulate the non-coherent point drift as .....  }

%\subsection{Image segmentation and co-segmentation}
%\label{subsec:coseg}
\noindent{\textbf{Image segmentation and co-segmentation}}
%
An influential work for interactive image segmentation is GrabCut~\cite{grabcut}. It uses two Gaussian mixture models, one for foreground and the other for background. 
To initialize these two Gaussian mixture models, a rectangle is manually placed to contain the foreground. 
Our design of interaction draws on the \mdf{experience} from \cite{grabcut}. 
%
The difference is that our interaction is designed for 3D space and can handle multi-object segmentation rather than foreground-background segmentation. 
%
\cite{Taniai_2016_CVPR} jointly recovers co-segmentation and dense per-pixel correspondences in two images. 
Its co-segmentation is limited to foreground-background segmentation. Our work solves a similar problem for multiple 3D point sets. 
\cxj{There are many image co-segmentation papers. If you want to discuss it, you should discuss more. }

\noindent{\textbf{Segmentation from Motion.}}
The idea that motion can be a strong hint for segmentation is used in many works.
\cite{Xu:2015:ACS:2816795.2818075} employs a robot to do proactive push and track the motion to learn object segmentation. 
\cite{unsupervisededge} exploits the motion in a video and uses the motion edges as the training data to learn an edge detector for image \cxj{use 'an image' or 'images'}. 
These methods lean on the motion that is continuous in time and can be tracked. Our method can handle motion that is not continuous in time.

\noindent{\textbf{3D Object Recognition based on Correspondence Grouping.}}
By allowing interactively input \mdf{the scene layout}, the joint registration and co-segmentation problem can be treated as a series of 3D object recognition problem in point sets. Our method should be classified as one of the correspondence grouping method. Comparing to previous methods \cxj{that uses ...}~\cite{hough,LOF}, our method simultaneously solve\mdf{s} the problem for multiple target models in multiple scenes.
