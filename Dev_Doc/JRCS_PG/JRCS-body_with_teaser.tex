\begin{abstract}
We present a method of joint registration and co-segmentation for point sets of objects. We view the joint registration and co-segmentation as two problems heavily entangled with each other. To model such entangled problems, we treat the input point sets as samples from a generative model and bring up with a novel formulation based on Gaussian mixture model. Under this formulation, we can gradually recover the latent object models and object level segmentation, by maximizing the posterior probability of the samples, Alone with the formulation, we design a procedure of interaction that can help user to intuitively initialize the optimization. Our evaluation shows that our novel method is helpful and effective to do the joint registration and co-segmentation on point sets of multiple objects.
