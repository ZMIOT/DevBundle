\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In many researches and applications of indoor scenes the data of segmented and even annotated 3D indoor scenes are required as either data base or training data (e.g.\cite{SceneFromExample}\cite{Fisher:2012:ESO:2366145.2366154}\cite{Chen:2014:ASM:2661229.2661239}\cite{Fisher:ActivityCentricSceneSynthesis}).\\
One way to build such data base is to interactively compose scenes from 3D shape models resulting in scenes with object segmentation and annotation naturally available, or to mannually segment and annotate existing scenes. This procedure can be tedious and time consuming, despite the efforts to improve the interaction experience(e.g.\cite{Merrell:2011:IFL:2010324.1964982}\cite{Xu:2013:SSC:2461912.2461968}).\\
Another way is to automatically generate scenes from 3D shape models according to the input RGB or RGB-D images(e.g.\cite{Liu2015Model}\cite{Chen:2014:ASM:2661229.2661239}). In such methods, a retrievial procedure is usually needed and inevitablely limit the result to a certain set of 3D models despite the actual 3D model in the input images.\\
We prefer a approach that helps us build such data set directly from the captured data. One of the major gap between the required data set ( with object level segmentations) and available scene capturing framework(e.g.\cite{KinectFusion}) is the general object level segmentation. We want to highlight that a general object segmentation should not be treated as an equivalence of multilabel classification. For 3D data, \cite{3DReasoningfromBlockstoStability} used  while .The work of \cite{Xu:2015:ACS:2816795.2818075} proposes a practical and a rather complete framework to close the gap. One of the key idea in \cite{Xu:2015:ACS:2816795.2818075} is that the motion consistency of rigid object can be strong evidence of general objectness. To exploit this, they employ a robot to do proactive push and use the movement tracking to verify and iteratively improve their object level segmentation result. Our work presented in this paper is trying to exploit the same idea with a different approach.\\
