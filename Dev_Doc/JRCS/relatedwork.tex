\subsection{Functional Mapping}
The Coupled Joint Registration and Co-segmentation problem addressed here is essentially a problem of point-to-point correspondence problem. A series of work based on the functional maps representation advocated in \cite{Ovsjanikov2012Functional} have be done. In one of the most recent work [], a convex relaxation technique was used to better approximate the global minimal for both rigid and non-rigid registration problem.
