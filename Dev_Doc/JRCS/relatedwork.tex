\subsection{Functional Mapping}
The coupled joint registration and co-segmentation problem comes with a latent problem of point-to-point correspondence problem. A series of work based on the functional maps representation advocated in \cite{Ovsjanikov:2012:FMF:2185520.2185526} have be done. In one of the most recent work \cite{Maron:2016:ConvRelax}, a convex relaxation technique was used to better approximate the global minimal for both rigid and non-rigid registration problem.
