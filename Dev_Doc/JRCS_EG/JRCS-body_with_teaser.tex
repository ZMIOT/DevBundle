	\begin{abstract}
		We present a novel approach of joint registration and co-segmentation for point sets where objects move in different ways. 
		Considering the joint registration and co-segmentation as two problems heavily entangled with each other, we represent the input point sets as samples from a generative model and bring up with a novel formulation based on Gaussian mixture model. %
		By maximizing the posterior probability of the samples, we gradually recover the latent object models as well as an object-level segmentation, and simultaneously align the segmented points to the latent object models. 
		%
		Along with the formulation, we design an interactive tool that helps users intuitively intervene the process to optimize the registration and segmentation result. 
		%
		The experiment results on a group of synthetic and scanned point clouds demonstrate that our method is powerful and effective for joint registration and co-segmentation on point sets of multiple objects.
